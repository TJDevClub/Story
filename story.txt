Once upon a time... some student made it into TJ.

It was a new kid from Georgia, named Naitian.

The student was overwhelmed with the diversity of TJ's student body. Georgia had recently seceded from the United States, and therefore was both a country and a state. How, you might wonder, does that happen? Good question.

Naitian needed a homecoming date, so he decided to ask this Cyborg robot thing he built named Karel.

He asked Karel to help him with his Multi homework, but then he realized that Karel could not help him, because that's honor coding.

As a result, Naitian struggled for hours on his homework. Unfortunately, he couldn't stop thinking about Karel, so he never finished his homework.

He ended up failing Multi all because of Karel.
